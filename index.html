		<h1>The Mission</h1>
		<p>If you travel often enough to think to not write a packing list, but not often enough to make packing automatic, you've come to the right place. At PackingList, Inc we are dedicated to offering an accurate list without any "just in case" items. (minimalism FTW)</p>

	<div>
		<h1>How to Use</h1>
		<p>All you need to enter is nights away, gender, season and purpose of your trip to get a pretty accurate packing list.</p>
		<h4>PLEASE NOTICE THAT THIS SITE IS IN BETA- SOME ITEMS MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE. SORRY IN ADVANCE.</h4>
